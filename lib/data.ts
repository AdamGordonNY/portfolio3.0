I completed it rather quickly and even added some animation to the page using framer motion.  I especially am fond of the group cards that fade in and then cascade outward.

The ability to query data on the server and then send it to the client is a powerful tool that can be used to make a page dynamic, fast, and save on resources.  Following the pattern of designing the HTML first, then adding the dynamic elements, is a good way to keep the project organized and my workflow on track.",
