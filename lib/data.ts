He was a great communicator with both the interns and myself. He also learned the ReactJS library and laid the groundwork for many students that followed him. Additionally, Adam also stayed on as a guide to some interns even after his official departure and has demonstrated a capacity to work well with team members, learn new skills on the job, and be a leader in his time working for this firm. He would be a great addition to any team, and I have no doubt he will impress, given the chance to thrive.",
